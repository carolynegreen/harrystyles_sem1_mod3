                <h1>Dunkirk</h1>
                <p>In 2017, Harry Styles made his acting debut in Christopher Nolan’s war film, Dunkirk, a true story about stranded Allied soldiers on the shores of Dunkirk who were rescued by civilian boats. Even playing a minor character, Alex, audiences were stunned by Styles’ excellent performance.</p>
                <p>I, myself, was completely overwhelmed by the experience and have now seen the film a number of times, just for his cameos. The film contained a star studded cast including Tom Hardy, Cillian Murphy, and Mark Rylance, but their performances were definitely overshadowed by Styles.</p>
                <p>The film won numerous awards, mainly for film and sound editing, and was nominated for Best Director and Best Picture at the 90th Academy Awards in 2018. I, myself, would have awarded Harry Styles Best Actor for his performance, and the film Best Picture just because he was so magnificent in the film.</p>

                <h1>Coming Soon</h1>
                <p>Olivia Wilde confirmed in early September that Styles would be joining the cast of her next film “Don’t Worry, Darling”, set to release sometime in 2021. “Don’t Worry, Darling” is supposedly a drama or thriller about a 1950’s housewife who will be played by rising star Florence Pugh.</p>
                <p>While not too much is known about Harry’s upcoming role, it is known that Dakota Johnson and Chris Pine will both be starring in the film as well. This is the only thing that is getting me through 2020.</p>
                <p>Another film Styles is rumored to be a part of is an adaptation of Bethan Roberts' LGBTQ novel <i>My Policeman</i>. The film is set to take place in 1950s England, where Styles plays a policeman, questioning his feelings for a woman and a man.</p>
