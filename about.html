                <h2>The Early Years</h2>
            </a>
            <p>Life began when Harry Edward Styles was born on February 1, 1994 in Holmes Chapel, a small town south of Manchester, England. Gemma Styles, Harry's sister, is four years older and lived with him and his mother when their parents divorced. Styles is notoriously known for having worked in a bakery, prior to auditioning for the X-Factor UK, which his mother signed him up for.</p>

            <p>At just 16 years old, Harry Styles took the X-Factor audition stage, performing a beautiful rendition of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wvtcimfrgs" id="youtubelink">Stevie Wonders "Isn't She Lovely"</a>. Styles made it through the first audition, but was unfortunately voted off during the final audition phase. But, as the Gods would have it, Simon Cowell made a decision to form a boyband from five rejected male solo artists. On July 23, 2010, One Direction was created and my life has never been the same. In addition to Styles, the other members of the group included Louis Tomlinson, Niall Horan, Liam Payne, and Zayn Malik.</p>

            </a>
            <p>Even though the band came in third place on the X-Factor, one could say they were the real winners of the show. The group went on to headline four sold out tours, release five wonderful studio albums, film seventeen of the best music videos the world has ever seen, and so much more.</p>
            <p>One Directions first single, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S3IQwuYX_ls" id="youtubelink2">"What Makes You Beautiful"</a>, was released on September 11, 2011 and was a huge success for the band, reaching number one in several countries. Their debut album, <i>Up All Night</i> was released a few months later. The band continued to release a new album every year for the next four years,<i>Take Me Home (2012), Midnight Memories (2013), Four (2014), and Made in the A.M. (2015)</i>.

            <p>Unfortunately, it was revealed that the band would be going on an indefinite hiatus in 2016 and my world came to an end. This decision came not long after the departure of Malik in 2015 and the remaining members' decision to work on solo projects. July 2020 marked the 10 year anniversary of the bands conception, and many fans waited in excitement for an annoucement about the bands reunion. However, we were not so lucky, and only got 4k versions of previously released music videos.</p>

            <p>Things were pretty bleak for a while. I wasn't a huge fan on the last One Direction album so I didn't even have that to console my emotions. When Harry styles revelead he was working on an album it was like a ray of sunshine during the worst thunderstorm, and even better, that he would soon be starring in a major motion film. I could feel my soul reentering my body, and it felt that all was right in the world again.</p>
            <p>Styles wasn't the only band member to move on and have success. All other members released their own solo albums and projects. Some even went on to start families. But at the end of the day, I do have to say that Harry Styles has become the most well known and most successful of the One Direction members.</p>
