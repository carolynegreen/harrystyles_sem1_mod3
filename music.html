            <h1>Harry Styles</h1>
            <p>In April 2017, Harry Styles released his first solo single <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qN4ooNx77u0" id="youtubelink"> "Sign of the Times”</a> which completely changed my life for the better. The music video featured styles flying over meadows, the ocean, and through the sky. It was magical.</p>
            <p>His self-titled solo album was released a month later, topping the charts in multiple countries, including the US and UK. According to Variety, the album was “a classic cocktail of psychedelia, Britpop, and balladry.” Other singles from the album include “Two Ghosts” and “Kiwi”.</p>

        <div class="finelines-album">
            <h1>Fine Lines</h1>
            <p>Styles second album, Fine Lines, was released December 2019. The debut single from the album, released 2 months earlier, was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9NZvM1918_E" id="youtubelink2">"Lights Up”</a>, a magical, synth heavy pop song I wasn’t too sure of at first but eventually grew to love.</p>
            <p>Just before the release of the album, Styles sent his fans into a frenzy, introducing them to the superstitious, folklore island of Eroda where nobody smiled except for one boy with a peculiar ability to blind people with his smile. This was the background for Styles next single <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VF-r5TtlT9w" id="youtubelink3">“Adore You”</a>, a favorite of mine.</p>
            <p>The next two singles, “Falling” and “Watermelon Sugar” were both released in 2020, and are probably the only good things to happen this year.</p>
